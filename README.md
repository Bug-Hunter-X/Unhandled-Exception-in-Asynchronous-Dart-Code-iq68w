# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error handling scenario in asynchronous Dart code using `try-catch-finally` blocks.  The example simulates an asynchronous operation that may throw an exception. The `finally` block ensures that cleanup actions are executed regardless of whether an exception occurs. The code is designed to illustrate best practices for exception handling in asynchronous Dart applications.

## How to run the code

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in your Dart IDE (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Run the `main` function in `bug.dart`.

## Solution

The provided solution in `bugSolution.dart` focuses on using the `try-catch-finally` block effectively to handle exceptions and ensure that the application does not crash. A more robust error handling mechanism would involve more sophisticated logging and error reporting strategies, but this example provides a fundamental framework.
